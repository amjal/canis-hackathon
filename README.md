# üéØ About Our Challenge
Diving deep into the data, our mission was to transform a raw dataset into a captivating visual narrative. We began by dissecting the CANIS data, seeking patterns and stories hidden within. Our journey took a twist as we embarked on scraping Twitter, gleaning insights from the web of interactions and content created by the users provided to us.

# üî¨ Our Methodology
Our approach was systematic and exploratory:
- **Data Gathering**: Initiated by a thorough analysis of CANIS data, then utilized scraping methods to gather more data regarding the state actors
- **Data Cleaning**: Filtered and cleaned data to gain higher quality results using our ML models.
- **Data Analysis**: Delved into the data to uncover trends, anomalies, and noteworthy findings.
- **Visualization**: Transformed our discoveries into an array of engaging, insightful visuals.


# üìë Submission Highlights
In our submission, you'll find:
- **Structured Presentation**: A cohesive narrative of our data journey, from raw figures to polished graphs.
- **Codebase**: Access to the code that powered our analysis, showcasing our technical acumen.

#üí° Acknowledgements
We used state-of-the-art language processing models for semantic search [^1], topic modelling [^2] and semantic classification [^3]. We created our web app using **_Streamlit_** and generated our visuals using a vast array of open-source tools such as **_Plotly_**, **_Matplotlib_**, **_Mapbox_**, **_NetworkX_**.
