Cui Tiankai Biography in Chinese - 崔天凯 中文传记，Cuītiānkǎi zhōngwén zhuànjì


== Early life and education ==
In 1952, Cui was born in Shanghai, China. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.Cui went to Shanghai Foreign Language School and graduated from the School of Foreign Languages of East China Normal University. Following his graduation from East China Normal University, Cui studied interpretation at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.


== Career ==
Following his studies in Beijing, Cui traveled with a Chinese delegation to the United Nations to work as an interpreter in the General Assembly.  After working in the UN for five years, Cui returned to academia to pursue a postgraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Cui joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, first as a deputy director of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences, and then as spokesman for the Information Department. In 1997, Cui was appointed Minister Counselor to the United Nations, a position he held until 1999. Cui continued to work with the Ministry throughout the next decade and held notable positions such as Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to Japan. In 2013, Cui was selected by the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, then appointed by President Xi Jinping as the Ambassador to the United States, pursuant to the National People's Congress decision. On 22 June 2021, after eight years, he announced that he would leave the position.


== Opinions ==
In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: ""There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!""On March 6, 2013, Cui was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. ""The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is whether Japan can accept a powerful and developed China."" Cui then said, if Japan can recognize and solve this problem, all other problems can be resolved.On October 8, 2013, Cui delivered a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""


== Other Events ==
In 2017, Tiankai Cui unprecedently attended the Bilderberg Group meeting in Chantilly, Virginia. Topics at the Bilderberg meeting often include China, Russia, and the establishment of an economic world order.

He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early life and education ==
In 1952, Cui was born in Shanghai, China. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.Cui went to Shanghai Foreign Language School and graduated from the School of Foreign Languages of East China Normal University. Following his graduation from East China Normal University, Cui studied interpretation at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.


== Career ==
Following his studies in Beijing, Cui traveled with a Chinese delegation to the United Nations to work as an interpreter in the General Assembly.  After working in the UN for five years, Cui returned to academia to pursue a postgraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Cui joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, first as a deputy director of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences, and then as spokesman for the Information Department. In 1997, Cui was appointed Minister Counselor to the United Nations, a position he held until 1999. Cui continued to work with the Ministry throughout the next decade and held notable positions such as Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to Japan.

On 22 June 2021, after eight years, he announced that he would leave the position.


== Opinions ==
In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: ""There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!""On March 6, 2013, Cui was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. ""The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is whether Japan can accept a powerful and developed China."" Cui then said, if Japan can recognize and solve this problem, all other problems can be resolved.On October 8, 2013, Cui delivered a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C.

Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.

In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: ""There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!""On March 6, 2013, Cui was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. ""The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is whether Japan can accept a powerful and developed China.""

He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===

== Early life and education ==
Qin Gang was born in Tianjin, China on 19 March 1966.Qin received a Bachelor of Laws with a major in international politics from the University of International Relations in 1988.


== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

In July 2021, Qin became the 11th Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States, succeeding Cui Tiankai, pursuant to a National People's Congress Standing Committee decision.On September 22, 2021, Qin advocated the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's concept of whole-process people's democracy at a conference organized by U.S. think tanks the Carter Center and The George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C.

Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.


== Personal life ==
Qin is married to Lin Yan. He has at least one son.

== Early life and education ==
In 1952, Cui was born in Shanghai, China. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.Cui went to Shanghai Foreign Language School and graduated from the School of Foreign Languages of East China Normal University. Following his graduation from East China Normal University, Cui studied interpretation at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.


== Career ==
Following his studies in Beijing, Cui traveled with a Chinese delegation to the United Nations to work as an interpreter in the General Assembly.  After working in the UN for five years, Cui returned to academia to pursue a postgraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Cui joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, first as a deputy director of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences, and then as spokesman for the Information Department. In 1997, Cui was appointed Minister Counselor to the United Nations, a position he held until 1999. Cui continued to work with the Ministry throughout the next decade and held notable positions such as Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to Japan. In 2013, Cui was selected by the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, then appointed by President Xi Jinping as the Ambassador to the United States, pursuant to the National People's Congress decision. On 22 June 2021, after eight years, he announced that he would leave the position.


== Opinions ==
In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: ""There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!""On March 6, 2013, Cui was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. ""The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is whether Japan can accept a powerful and developed China."" Cui then said, if Japan can recognize and solve this problem, all other problems can be resolved.On October 8, 2013, Cui delivered a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""


== Other Events ==

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early life and education ==
Qin Gang was born in Tianjin, China on 19 March 1966.Qin received a Bachelor of Laws with a major in international politics from the University of International Relations in 1988.


== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.
In September 2010, Qin was appointed as the Envoy of the People's Republic of China to the United Kingdom.

From 2014 to 2017, Qin served as the Director General of the Foreign Ministry Protocol Department. He became Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in 2017 and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in September 2018.


== Ambassador to the United States ==
In July 2021, Qin became the 11th Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States, succeeding Cui Tiankai, pursuant to a National People's Congress Standing Committee decision.On September 22, 2021, Qin advocated the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's concept of whole-process people's democracy at a conference organized by U.S. think tanks the Carter Center and The George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C. Qin served as the official host of the event.In August 2022, Qin called the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan a ""farce"" and a ""total political provocation.""


== Minister of Foreign Affairs ==
Qin was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of China on 30 December 2022, succeeding Wang Yi. He vacated the post of Chinese ambassador to the United States on 5 January 2023. Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.


== Personal life ==
Qin is married to Lin Yan. He has at least one son.

He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London.

He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"".

The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C.

Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day.

The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.

== Early life and education ==
In 1952, Cui was born in Shanghai, China. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.Cui went to Shanghai Foreign Language School and graduated from the School of Foreign Languages of East China Normal University. Following his graduation from East China Normal University, Cui studied interpretation at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.


== Career ==
Following his studies in Beijing, Cui traveled with a Chinese delegation to the United Nations to work as an interpreter in the General Assembly.  After working in the UN for five years, Cui returned to academia to pursue a postgraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Cui joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, first as a deputy director of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences, and then as spokesman for the Information Department. In 1997, Cui was appointed Minister Counselor to the United Nations, a position he held until 1999. Cui continued to work with the Ministry throughout the next decade and held notable positions such as Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to Japan. In 2013, Cui was selected by the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, then appointed by President Xi Jinping as the Ambassador to the United States, pursuant to the National People's Congress decision.

== Opinions ==
In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: ""There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!""On March 6, 2013, Cui was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. ""The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is whether Japan can accept a powerful and developed China."" Cui then said, if Japan can recognize and solve this problem, all other problems can be resolved.On October 8, 2013, Cui delivered a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""


== Other Events ==

Topics at the Bilderberg meeting often include China, Russia, and the establishment of an economic world order.

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early life and education ==
Qin Gang was born in Tianjin, China on 19 March 1966.Qin received a Bachelor of Laws with a major in international politics from the University of International Relations in 1988.


== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.
In September 2010, Qin was appointed as the Envoy of the People's Republic of China to the United Kingdom.

From 2014 to 2017, Qin served as the Director General of the Foreign Ministry Protocol Department. He became Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in 2017 and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in September 2018.


== Ambassador to the United States ==
In July 2021, Qin became the 11th Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States, succeeding Cui Tiankai, pursuant to a National People's Congress Standing Committee decision.On September 22, 2021, Qin advocated the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's concept of whole-process people's democracy at a conference organized by U.S. think tanks the Carter Center and The George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C. Qin served as the official host of the event.In August 2022, Qin called the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan a ""farce"" and a ""total political provocation.""


== Minister of Foreign Affairs ==
Qin was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of China on 30 December 2022, succeeding Wang Yi. He vacated the post of Chinese ambassador to the United States on 5 January 2023. Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.


== Personal life ==
Qin is married to Lin Yan. He has at least one son.

He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London.

He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"".

The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C.

Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day.

The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.

Zhang Meifang,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Meifang,"Zhang Meifang (Chinese: 张美芳; pinyin: Zhāng Měifāng) is a Chinese diplomat who is serving as the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Belfast, United Kingdom since 2018.


== Early life and education ==
Zhang graduated from East China Normal University and in master of philosophy from the University of Cambridge. She served as a senior visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University. She is married to politician Liu Haixing, who is currently serving as the executive deputy director of the office of the National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. The couple have a daughter.


== Career ==
Zhang has previous served in a variety of roles within China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including as first secretary at the Chinese Permanent Mission to the United Nations from 1997 to 2001, first secretary at the Chinese Embassy in France from 2001 to 2004, deputy consul general at the Chinese consulates in Toronto from 2008 to 2013 and New York from 2013 to 2018.In December 2018, she was appointed as the Chinese consul general in Belfast.


=== Statements ===
According to the online statistics collected by the German Marshall Fund, Zhang had engaged in extensive forwarding of pro-Russian and anti-Western messages in Twitter since the outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. One of them being a false news, first shared by a pro-China Twitter account, that President of Ukraine Volodomyr Zelenskyy fled to Poland during the invasion.On 14 August 2022, following Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on 2 August 2022, CGTN published an opinion piece by Zhang where she stated that ""the one-China principle was violated by a foolish action of a desperate nation, desperate to distract its own people from troubles at home"" and the ""Taiwan region is not a pawn to be played in some deviant global chess game. No nation will sit idly by in such matters.""On 23 August, Zhang shared a post on Twitter listing the wars participated by the United States as ""the history of American aggression in a snapshot!"" As the list involves wars that the United States did not start such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, World War II and Korean War, many online users questioned how come Zhang considers World War II as an American aggression as the United States entered into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and then provided military aid to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the post resulted in heated commentary, it was deleted without any explanation.On 4 February 2023, following the shootdown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon which flew across Canada and the United States by the United States Air Force, Zhang joked about it on Twitter stating that “perhaps China was simply giving the US a balloon, much like one would give a child to make them feel better” and if anyone else ""finds this balloon fiasco to be nothing more than a bunch of hot air?”On 13 February, in the aftermath of the devastating Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February, Zhang uploaded a video to Twitter that inaccurately claimed that the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge withstood the earthquake thanks to Chinese technology. Zhang wrote, ""The bridge built by China in Turkey’s withstood the earthquake #ChinaTech."" She also falsely claimed that ""a subsidiary of Shudao Group is the sole participant in the construction."" However, the bridge was built by South Korean conglomerate DL E&C along with Turkish conglomerate Limak Holding as well as South Korean company SK Group and Turkish company Yapi Merkezi while China's Sichuan Road and Bridge Group was only responsible for the installation of the bridge's steel box girders on December 2020. The bridge was also unlikely to be in any danger from the earthquake, as it is located approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) northwest from Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the quake's epicenter. The video had been viewed more than 200,000 times before it was deleted the next day. The official Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France also forwarded Zhang's tweet, but deleted it after learning the relevant facts.

== Early life and education ==
In 1952, Cui was born in Shanghai, China. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.Cui went to Shanghai Foreign Language School and graduated from the School of Foreign Languages of East China Normal University. Following his graduation from East China Normal University, Cui studied interpretation at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.


== Career ==
Following his studies in Beijing, Cui traveled with a Chinese delegation to the United Nations to work as an interpreter in the General Assembly.  After working in the UN for five years, Cui returned to academia to pursue a postgraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Cui joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, first as a deputy director of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences, and then as spokesman for the Information Department. In 1997, Cui was appointed Minister Counselor to the United Nations, a position he held until 1999. Cui continued to work with the Ministry throughout the next decade and held notable positions such as Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to Japan. In 2013, Cui was selected by the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, then appointed by President Xi Jinping as the Ambassador to the United States, pursuant to the National People's Congress decision. On 22 June 2021, after eight years, he announced that he would leave the position.


== Opinions ==
In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: ""There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!""On March 6, 2013, Cui was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. ""The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is whether Japan can accept a powerful and developed China."" Cui then said, if Japan can recognize and solve this problem, all other problems can be resolved.On October 8, 2013, Cui delivered a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""


== Other Events ==

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early life and education ==
Qin Gang was born in Tianjin, China on 19 March 1966.Qin received a Bachelor of Laws with a major in international politics from the University of International Relations in 1988.


== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.
In September 2010, Qin was appointed as the Envoy of the People's Republic of China to the United Kingdom.

From 2014 to 2017, Qin served as the Director General of the Foreign Ministry Protocol Department. He became Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in 2017 and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in September 2018.


== Ambassador to the United States ==
In July 2021, Qin became the 11th Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States, succeeding Cui Tiankai, pursuant to a National People's Congress Standing Committee decision.On September 22, 2021, Qin advocated the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's concept of whole-process people's democracy at a conference organized by U.S. think tanks the Carter Center and The George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C. Qin served as the official host of the event.In August 2022, Qin called the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan a ""farce"" and a ""total political provocation.""


== Minister of Foreign Affairs ==
Qin was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of China on 30 December 2022, succeeding Wang Yi. He vacated the post of Chinese ambassador to the United States on 5 January 2023. Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.


== Personal life ==
Qin is married to Lin Yan. He has at least one son.

Zhang Meifang,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Meifang,"Zhang Meifang (Chinese: 张美芳; pinyin: Zhāng Měifāng) is a Chinese diplomat who is serving as the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Belfast, United Kingdom since 2018.


== Early life and education ==
Zhang graduated from East China Normal University and in master of philosophy from the University of Cambridge. She served as a senior visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University. She is married to politician Liu Haixing, who is currently serving as the executive deputy director of the office of the National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. The couple have a daughter.


== Career ==
Zhang has previous served in a variety of roles within China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including as first secretary at the Chinese Permanent Mission to the United Nations from 1997 to 2001, first secretary at the Chinese Embassy in France from 2001 to 2004, deputy consul general at the Chinese consulates in Toronto from 2008 to 2013 and New York from 2013 to 2018.In December 2018, she was appointed as the Chinese consul general in Belfast.


=== Statements ===
According to the online statistics collected by the German Marshall Fund, Zhang had engaged in extensive forwarding of pro-Russian and anti-Western messages in Twitter since the outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. One of them being a false news, first shared by a pro-China Twitter account, that President of Ukraine Volodomyr Zelenskyy fled to Poland during the invasion.On 14 August 2022, following Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on 2 August 2022, CGTN published an opinion piece by Zhang where she stated that ""the one-China principle was violated by a foolish action of a desperate nation, desperate to distract its own people from troubles at home"" and the ""Taiwan region is not a pawn to be played in some deviant global chess game. No nation will sit idly by in such matters.""On 23 August, Zhang shared a post on Twitter listing the wars participated by the United States as ""the history of American aggression in a snapshot!"" As the list involves wars that the United States did not start such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, World War II and Korean War, many online users questioned how come Zhang considers World War II as an American aggression as the United States entered into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and then provided military aid to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the post resulted in heated commentary, it was deleted without any explanation.On 4 February 2023, following the shootdown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon which flew across Canada and the United States by the United States Air Force, Zhang joked about it on Twitter stating that “perhaps China was simply giving the US a balloon, much like one would give a child to make them feel better” and if anyone else ""finds this balloon fiasco to be nothing more than a bunch of hot air?”On 13 February, in the aftermath of the devastating Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February, Zhang uploaded a video to Twitter that inaccurately claimed that the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge withstood the earthquake thanks to Chinese technology. Zhang wrote, ""The bridge built by China in Turkey’s withstood the earthquake #ChinaTech."" She also falsely claimed that ""a subsidiary of Shudao Group is the sole participant in the construction."" However, the bridge was built by South Korean conglomerate DL E&C along with Turkish conglomerate Limak Holding as well as South Korean company SK Group and Turkish company Yapi Merkezi while China's Sichuan Road and Bridge Group was only responsible for the installation of the bridge's steel box girders on December 2020. The bridge was also unlikely to be in any danger from the earthquake, as it is located approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) northwest from Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the quake's epicenter. The video had been viewed more than 200,000 times before it was deleted the next day. The official Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France also forwarded Zhang's tweet, but deleted it after learning the relevant facts.

He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early life and education ==
Qin Gang was born in Tianjin, China on 19 March 1966.Qin received a Bachelor of Laws with a major in international politics from the University of International Relations in 1988.


== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.
In September 2010, Qin was appointed as the Envoy of the People's Republic of China to the United Kingdom.

From 2014 to 2017, Qin served as the Director General of the Foreign Ministry Protocol Department. He became Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in 2017 and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in September 2018.


== Ambassador to the United States ==
In July 2021, Qin became the 11th Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States, succeeding Cui Tiankai, pursuant to a National People's Congress Standing Committee decision.On September 22, 2021, Qin advocated the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's concept of whole-process people's democracy at a conference organized by U.S. think tanks the Carter Center and The George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C. Qin served as the official host of the event.In August 2022, Qin called the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan a ""farce"" and a ""total political provocation.""


== Minister of Foreign Affairs ==
Qin was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of China on 30 December 2022, succeeding Wang Yi. He vacated the post of Chinese ambassador to the United States on 5 January 2023. Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.


== Personal life ==
Qin is married to Lin Yan. He has at least one son.

Zhang graduated from East China Normal University and in master of philosophy from the University of Cambridge. She served as a senior visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University. She is married to politician Liu Haixing, who is currently serving as the executive deputy director of the office of the National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. The couple have a daughter.


== Career ==
Zhang has previous served in a variety of roles within China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including as first secretary at the Chinese Permanent Mission to the United Nations from 1997 to 2001, first secretary at the Chinese Embassy in France from 2001 to 2004, deputy consul general at the Chinese consulates in Toronto from 2008 to 2013 and New York from 2013 to 2018.In December 2018, she was appointed as the Chinese consul general in Belfast.


=== Statements ===
According to the online statistics collected by the German Marshall Fund, Zhang had engaged in extensive forwarding of pro-Russian and anti-Western messages in Twitter since the outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. One of them being a false news, first shared by a pro-China Twitter account, that President of Ukraine Volodomyr Zelenskyy fled to Poland during the invasion.On 14 August 2022, following Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on 2 August 2022, CGTN published an opinion piece by Zhang where she stated that ""the one-China principle was violated by a foolish action of a desperate nation, desperate to distract its own people from troubles at home"" and the ""Taiwan region is not a pawn to be played in some deviant global chess game. No nation will sit idly by in such matters.""On 23 August, Zhang shared a post on Twitter listing the wars participated by the United States as ""the history of American aggression in a snapshot!"" As the list involves wars that the United States did not start such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, World War II and Korean War, many online users questioned how come Zhang considers World War II as an American aggression as the United States entered into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and then provided military aid to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the post resulted in heated commentary, it was deleted without any explanation.On 4 February 2023, following the shootdown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon which flew across Canada and the United States by the United States Air Force, Zhang joked about it on Twitter stating that “perhaps China was simply giving the US a balloon, much like one would give a child to make them feel better” and if anyone else ""finds this balloon fiasco to be nothing more than a bunch of hot air?”On 13 February, in the aftermath of the devastating Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February, Zhang uploaded a video to Twitter that inaccurately claimed that the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge withstood the earthquake thanks to Chinese technology. Zhang wrote, ""The bridge built by China in Turkey’s withstood the earthquake #ChinaTech."" She also falsely claimed that ""a subsidiary of Shudao Group is the sole participant in the construction."" However, the bridge was built by South Korean conglomerate DL E&C along with Turkish conglomerate Limak Holding as well as South Korean company SK Group and Turkish company Yapi Merkezi while China's Sichuan Road and Bridge Group was only responsible for the installation of the bridge's steel box girders on December 2020. The bridge was also unlikely to be in any danger from the earthquake, as it is located approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) northwest from Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the quake's epicenter. The video had been viewed more than 200,000 times before it was deleted the next day. The official Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France also forwarded Zhang's tweet, but deleted it after learning the relevant facts.

He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

He became Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in 2017 and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in September 2018.


== Ambassador to the United States ==
In July 2021, Qin became the 11th Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States, succeeding Cui Tiankai, pursuant to a National People's Congress Standing Committee decision.On September 22, 2021, Qin advocated the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's concept of whole-process people's democracy at a conference organized by U.S. think tanks the Carter Center and The George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C. Qin served as the official host of the event.In August 2022, Qin called the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan a ""farce"" and a ""total political provocation.""


== Minister of Foreign Affairs ==
Qin was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of China on 30 December 2022, succeeding Wang Yi. He vacated the post of Chinese ambassador to the United States on 5 January 2023. Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.


== Personal life ==
Qin is married to Lin Yan. He has at least one son.

No nation will sit idly by in such matters.""On 23 August, Zhang shared a post on Twitter listing the wars participated by the United States as ""the history of American aggression in a snapshot!"" As the list involves wars that the United States did not start such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, World War II and Korean War, many online users questioned how come Zhang considers World War II as an American aggression as the United States entered into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and then provided military aid to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the post resulted in heated commentary, it was deleted without any explanation.On 4 February 2023, following the shootdown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon which flew across Canada and the United States by the United States Air Force, Zhang joked about it on Twitter stating that “perhaps China was simply giving the US a balloon, much like one would give a child to make them feel better” and if anyone else ""finds this balloon fiasco to be nothing more than a bunch of hot air?”On 13 February, in the aftermath of the devastating Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February, Zhang uploaded a video to Twitter that inaccurately claimed that the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge withstood the earthquake thanks to Chinese technology. Zhang wrote, ""The bridge built by China in Turkey’s withstood the earthquake #ChinaTech."" She also falsely claimed that ""a subsidiary of Shudao Group is the sole participant in the construction."" However, the bridge was built by South Korean conglomerate DL E&C along with Turkish conglomerate Limak Holding as well as South Korean company SK Group and Turkish company Yapi Merkezi while China's Sichuan Road and Bridge Group was only responsible for the installation of the bridge's steel box girders on December 2020. The bridge was also unlikely to be in any danger from the earthquake, as it is located approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) northwest from Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the quake's epicenter. The video had been viewed more than 200,000 times before it was deleted the next day. The official Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France also forwarded Zhang's tweet, but deleted it after learning the relevant facts.

== Early life and education ==
In 1952, Cui was born in Shanghai, China. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, China.Cui went to Shanghai Foreign Language School and graduated from the School of Foreign Languages of East China Normal University. Following his graduation from East China Normal University, Cui studied interpretation at the Beijing Foreign Studies University.

Following his studies in Beijing, Cui traveled with a Chinese delegation to the United Nations to work as an interpreter in the General Assembly.  After working in the UN for five years, Cui returned to academia to pursue a postgraduate degree from Johns Hopkins University's Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C.After graduating from Johns Hopkins University, Cui joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, first as a deputy director of the Department of International Organizations and Conferences, and then as spokesman for the Information Department. In 1997, Cui was appointed Minister Counselor to the United Nations, a position he held until 1999. Cui continued to work with the Ministry throughout the next decade and held notable positions such as Director General of the Department of Asian Affairs, assistant minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ambassador to Japan. In 2013, Cui was selected by the 12th Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, then appointed by President Xi Jinping as the Ambassador to the United States, pursuant to the National People's Congress decision. On 22 June 2021, after eight years, he announced that he would leave the position.


== Opinions ==
In 2012, the case of the blind activist Chen Guangcheng triggered a diplomatic dispute between China and the US. Chen was permitted to study law in mainland China before going to the US for further studies. When Cui saw the shortlist of the universities that the Americans recommended, he roared: ""There's no way he's going to East China Normal, I will not share an alma mater with that man!""On March 6, 2013, Cui was interviewed by reporters from China Youth Daily when he attended the National People's Congress. ""The root cause of all problems in Sino-Japan relationship is whether Japan can accept a powerful and developed China."" Cui then said, if Japan can recognize and solve this problem, all other problems can be resolved.On October 8, 2013, Cui delivered a speech at the School of Advanced International Studies at the Johns Hopkins University. He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people.

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early life and education ==
Qin Gang was born in Tianjin, China on 19 March 1966.Qin received a Bachelor of Laws with a major in international politics from the University of International Relations in 1988.


== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

From 2014 to 2017, Qin served as the Director General of the Foreign Ministry Protocol Department. He became Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in 2017 and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of China in September 2018.


== Ambassador to the United States ==
In July 2021, Qin became the 11th Ambassador of the People's Republic of China to the United States, succeeding Cui Tiankai, pursuant to a National People's Congress Standing Committee decision.On September 22, 2021, Qin advocated the CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping's concept of whole-process people's democracy at a conference organized by U.S. think tanks the Carter Center and The George H.W. Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C. Qin served as the official host of the event.In August 2022, Qin called the 2022 visit by Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan a ""farce"" and a ""total political provocation.""


== Minister of Foreign Affairs ==
Qin was appointed as Minister of Foreign Affairs of China on 30 December 2022, succeeding Wang Yi. He vacated the post of Chinese ambassador to the United States on 5 January 2023. Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.


== Personal life ==
Qin is married to Lin Yan. He has at least one son.

Zhang has previous served in a variety of roles within China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including as first secretary at the Chinese Permanent Mission to the United Nations from 1997 to 2001, first secretary at the Chinese Embassy in France from 2001 to 2004, deputy consul general at the Chinese consulates in Toronto from 2008 to 2013 and New York from 2013 to 2018.In December 2018, she was appointed as the Chinese consul general in Belfast.


=== Statements ===
According to the online statistics collected by the German Marshall Fund, Zhang had engaged in extensive forwarding of pro-Russian and anti-Western messages in Twitter since the outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. One of them being a false news, first shared by a pro-China Twitter account, that President of Ukraine Volodomyr Zelenskyy fled to Poland during the invasion.On 14 August 2022, following Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on 2 August 2022, CGTN published an opinion piece by Zhang where she stated that ""the one-China principle was violated by a foolish action of a desperate nation, desperate to distract its own people from troubles at home"" and the ""Taiwan region is not a pawn to be played in some deviant global chess game. No nation will sit idly by in such matters.""On 23 August, Zhang shared a post on Twitter listing the wars participated by the United States as ""the history of American aggression in a snapshot!"" As the list involves wars that the United States did not start such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, World War II and Korean War, many online users questioned how come Zhang considers World War II as an American aggression as the United States entered into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and then provided military aid to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the post resulted in heated commentary, it was deleted without any explanation.On 4 February 2023, following the shootdown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon which flew across Canada and the United States by the United States Air Force, Zhang joked about it on Twitter stating that “perhaps China was simply giving the US a balloon, much like one would give a child to make them feel better” and if anyone else ""finds this balloon fiasco to be nothing more than a bunch of hot air?”On 13 February, in the aftermath of the devastating Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February, Zhang uploaded a video to Twitter that inaccurately claimed that the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge withstood the earthquake thanks to Chinese technology. Zhang wrote, ""The bridge built by China in Turkey’s withstood the earthquake #ChinaTech."" She also falsely claimed that ""a subsidiary of Shudao Group is the sole participant in the construction."" However, the bridge was built by South Korean conglomerate DL E&C along with Turkish conglomerate Limak Holding as well as South Korean company SK Group and Turkish company Yapi Merkezi while China's Sichuan Road and Bridge Group was only responsible for the installation of the bridge's steel box girders on December 2020. The bridge was also unlikely to be in any danger from the earthquake, as it is located approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) northwest from Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the quake's epicenter. The video had been viewed more than 200,000 times before it was deleted the next day. The official Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France also forwarded Zhang's tweet, but deleted it after learning the relevant facts.

Hua Chunying,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Chunying,"Hua Chunying (Chinese: 华春莹; born 24 April 1970) is a Chinese diplomat who has been serving as Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China since 2021 and the fifth spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 2012. 
After graduating from Nanjing University with a major in English language and literature in 1992, Hua joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a section member. She served as staff member, attaché, and third secretary in the Ministry's Department of Western Europe and the China Embassy in Singapore from 1992 to 2003. She served as second secretary, first secretary, and then counselor in the Mission of China to the European Union from 2003 to 2010. Hua then served as counselor at the Department of European Affairs from 2010 to 2012, deputy director of information from 2012 to 2019, and director of information from 2019 to 2021. She was appointed as the assistant minister of foreign affairs in 2021.


== Early life ==
Hua was born in Huai'an, Jiangsu. Both her parents were officials. Her father was formerly secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Huai'an County Discipline Inspection Commission, and her mother was the deputy director of a local district. She graduated from Nanjing University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in English language and literature.


== Career ==
After graduation, Hua joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China as a section member in the ministry's Department of Western Europe. Over a period of 20 years, Hua worked her way up to the position of spokeswoman. From 1995, she spent four years in Singapore as an attaché. During 2003 to 2010, she was promoted from secretary to counselor in China's mission to the European Union.
In 2012, Hua was promoted to deputy director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She served concurrently as the spokeswoman for the ministry. In February 2018, during a prolonged absence at the Foreign Ministry, there were reports that Hua was investigated for storing large amounts of U.S. dollars in her home. On March 1, 2018, Hua returned to work as Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.On July 18, 2019, she was appointed director of the Foreign Ministry Information Department of the People's Republic of China, succeeding Lu Kang. She became the second female director-general of the Information Department after Gong Peng, the very first director-general of this department. In October 2021, she was promoted to assistant minister of foreign affairs. Hua oversees the ministry’s work related to information, protocol, and translation. Hua was a delegate to the 19th and 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.


== Commentary ==
Hua has criticized the US plea to release Pu Zhiqiang, saying, ""I think lots of people have the same feeling with me, that some people in the United States have hearts that are too big and hands that are too long. Washington should address human rights problems at home and stop trying to be the world's policeman or judge.""In 2021, she compared the January 6 United States Capitol attack with the 2019 storming of the Legislative Council Complex.


=== COVID-19 conspiracy theory ===

In January 2021, Hua renewed the conspiracy theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in the United States at the Fort Detrick Army Medical Command Installation. Her words quickly went trending on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, and Hua continued to cite evidence on Twitter, while asking the government of the United States to open up Fort Detrick for further investigation to determine if it is the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.


=== Social media ===
In February 2021, Hua said that many Western officials use Weibo and Wechat, and asked, ""Why can't Chinese people use Twitter or Facebook when foreigners can use Chinese social media platforms?"" Twitter and Facebook have been banned by the mainland Chinese government since 2009.


=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

On 24 February, at a Chinese Foreign Ministry press conference, Hua said that, ""China is still the only permanent member of the United Nations Security Council that has not yet achieved the complete reunification of the motherland."" The situation with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine would be instructive to learn “how to fight the armed reunification”. Just as she foresaw resolution of the European conflict within 48 hours, if the “war of reunification of Taiwan” starts, the “highest goal” of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would be to “reunify Taiwan”. The PLA would not delay and thus not give adversaries the time and opportunity to intervene militarily and politically. In Hua's vision, the PLA would also ""defeat the island’s naval and air forces in the shortest possible time, seize air and sea control, provide security for subsequent landing operations, eliminate Taiwan’s combat power within 48 hours, and take full control of Taiwan within 72 hours.""


=== Taiwan ===

In August 2022, Hua warned that Nancy Pelosi should not visit Taiwan, threatening that, ""We closely follow Pelosi's itinerary. If the U.S. insists on going its own way, China will take firm and powerful measures to safeguard China’s sovereignty and security interests."" Later that month, after Pelosi's visit, Hua made a tweet asserting that Taiwan was a part of China because ""Baidu Maps show [sic] that there are 38 Shandong dumpling restaurants and 67 Shanxi noodle restaurants in Taipei."" The tweet was ridiculed by other Twitter users, who replied with examples of restaurant listings across the world.

Liu Xiaoming,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Xiaoming,"Liu Xiaoming (Chinese: 刘晓明; born 16 January 1956) is a Chinese diplomat who is currently the special representative of the Chinese government on the Korean Peninsula affairs.
Liu previously served as the Chinese ambassador to Egypt from 2001 to 2003, the ambassador to North Korea from 2006 to 2010, and the ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2010 to 2021.


== Early life and career ==
Liu graduated from Dalian University of Foreign Languages with a major in English and undertook further studies in the United States, obtaining a master's degree in international relations from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in 1983.Between 2001 and 2003, Liu acted as China's ambassador in Egypt, and from 2006 to 2010 as Chinese ambassador in North Korea.


== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London. Liu dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". On 25 November 2019, the Financial Times published a column by Liu. He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"". He further said ""Recently, however, the House of Commons foreign affairs select committee issued a report accusing China of ""interfering"" with academic freedom in British universities. The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C.

Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day. With a tenure of 207 days, Qin is the shortest-serving minister of foreign affairs of the People's Republic of China.The sixth meeting of the Standing Committee of the 14th National People's Congress, concluded on 24 October 24 2023, decided to remove Qin Gang from the post of State Councilor, and remove Li Shangfu from the posts of State Councilor and Minister of National Defense.


==== Speculation ====
According to a September 19, 2023 article by The Wall Street Journal, Qin had engaged in an extramarital relationship while serving as ambassador. The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.

Zhang Meifang,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Meifang,"Zhang Meifang (Chinese: 张美芳; pinyin: Zhāng Měifāng) is a Chinese diplomat who is serving as the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Belfast, United Kingdom since 2018.


== Early life and education ==
Zhang graduated from East China Normal University and in master of philosophy from the University of Cambridge. She served as a senior visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University. She is married to politician Liu Haixing, who is currently serving as the executive deputy director of the office of the National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. The couple have a daughter.


== Career ==
Zhang has previous served in a variety of roles within China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including as first secretary at the Chinese Permanent Mission to the United Nations from 1997 to 2001, first secretary at the Chinese Embassy in France from 2001 to 2004, deputy consul general at the Chinese consulates in Toronto from 2008 to 2013 and New York from 2013 to 2018.In December 2018, she was appointed as the Chinese consul general in Belfast.


=== Statements ===
According to the online statistics collected by the German Marshall Fund, Zhang had engaged in extensive forwarding of pro-Russian and anti-Western messages in Twitter since the outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. One of them being a false news, first shared by a pro-China Twitter account, that President of Ukraine Volodomyr Zelenskyy fled to Poland during the invasion.On 14 August 2022, following Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on 2 August 2022, CGTN published an opinion piece by Zhang where she stated that ""the one-China principle was violated by a foolish action of a desperate nation, desperate to distract its own people from troubles at home"" and the ""Taiwan region is not a pawn to be played in some deviant global chess game. No nation will sit idly by in such matters.""On 23 August, Zhang shared a post on Twitter listing the wars participated by the United States as ""the history of American aggression in a snapshot!"" As the list involves wars that the United States did not start such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, World War II and Korean War, many online users questioned how come Zhang considers World War II as an American aggression as the United States entered into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and then provided military aid to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the post resulted in heated commentary, it was deleted without any explanation.On 4 February 2023, following the shootdown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon which flew across Canada and the United States by the United States Air Force, Zhang joked about it on Twitter stating that “perhaps China was simply giving the US a balloon, much like one would give a child to make them feel better” and if anyone else ""finds this balloon fiasco to be nothing more than a bunch of hot air?”On 13 February, in the aftermath of the devastating Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February, Zhang uploaded a video to Twitter that inaccurately claimed that the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge withstood the earthquake thanks to Chinese technology. Zhang wrote, ""The bridge built by China in Turkey’s withstood the earthquake #ChinaTech."" She also falsely claimed that ""a subsidiary of Shudao Group is the sole participant in the construction."" However, the bridge was built by South Korean conglomerate DL E&C along with Turkish conglomerate Limak Holding as well as South Korean company SK Group and Turkish company Yapi Merkezi while China's Sichuan Road and Bridge Group was only responsible for the installation of the bridge's steel box girders on December 2020. The bridge was also unlikely to be in any danger from the earthquake, as it is located approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) northwest from Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the quake's epicenter. The video had been viewed more than 200,000 times before it was deleted the next day. The official Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France also forwarded Zhang's tweet, but deleted it after learning the relevant facts.

Hua Chunying,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Chunying,"Hua Chunying (Chinese: 华春莹; born 24 April 1970) is a Chinese diplomat who has been serving as Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China since 2021 and the fifth spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 2012. 
After graduating from Nanjing University with a major in English language and literature in 1992, Hua joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a section member. She served as staff member, attaché, and third secretary in the Ministry's Department of Western Europe and the China Embassy in Singapore from 1992 to 2003. She served as second secretary, first secretary, and then counselor in the Mission of China to the European Union from 2003 to 2010. Hua then served as counselor at the Department of European Affairs from 2010 to 2012, deputy director of information from 2012 to 2019, and director of information from 2019 to 2021. She was appointed as the assistant minister of foreign affairs in 2021.


== Early life ==
Hua was born in Huai'an, Jiangsu. Both her parents were officials. Her father was formerly secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Huai'an County Discipline Inspection Commission, and her mother was the deputy director of a local district. She graduated from Nanjing University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in English language and literature.


== Career ==
After graduation, Hua joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China as a section member in the ministry's Department of Western Europe. Over a period of 20 years, Hua worked her way up to the position of spokeswoman. From 1995, she spent four years in Singapore as an attaché. During 2003 to 2010, she was promoted from secretary to counselor in China's mission to the European Union.
In 2012, Hua was promoted to deputy director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She served concurrently as the spokeswoman for the ministry. In February 2018, during a prolonged absence at the Foreign Ministry, there were reports that Hua was investigated for storing large amounts of U.S. dollars in her home. On March 1, 2018, Hua returned to work as Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.On July 18, 2019, she was appointed director of the Foreign Ministry Information Department of the People's Republic of China, succeeding Lu Kang. She became the second female director-general of the Information Department after Gong Peng, the very first director-general of this department. In October 2021, she was promoted to assistant minister of foreign affairs. Hua oversees the ministry’s work related to information, protocol, and translation. Hua was a delegate to the 19th and 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.


== Commentary ==
Hua has criticized the US plea to release Pu Zhiqiang, saying, ""I think lots of people have the same feeling with me, that some people in the United States have hearts that are too big and hands that are too long. Washington should address human rights problems at home and stop trying to be the world's policeman or judge.""In 2021, she compared the January 6 United States Capitol attack with the 2019 storming of the Legislative Council Complex.


=== COVID-19 conspiracy theory ===

In January 2021, Hua renewed the conspiracy theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in the United States at the Fort Detrick Army Medical Command Installation. Her words quickly went trending on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, and Hua continued to cite evidence on Twitter, while asking the government of the United States to open up Fort Detrick for further investigation to determine if it is the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.


=== Social media ===
In February 2021, Hua said that many Western officials use Weibo and Wechat, and asked, ""Why can't Chinese people use Twitter or Facebook when foreigners can use Chinese social media platforms?"" Twitter and Facebook have been banned by the mainland Chinese government since 2009.


=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

On 24 February, at a Chinese Foreign Ministry press conference, Hua said that, ""China is still the only permanent member of the United Nations Security Council that has not yet achieved the complete reunification of the motherland."" The situation with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine would be instructive to learn “how to fight the armed reunification”. Just as she foresaw resolution of the European conflict within 48 hours, if the “war of reunification of Taiwan” starts, the “highest goal” of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would be to “reunify Taiwan”. The PLA would not delay and thus not give adversaries the time and opportunity to intervene militarily and politically. In Hua's vision, the PLA would also ""defeat the island’s naval and air forces in the shortest possible time, seize air and sea control, provide security for subsequent landing operations, eliminate Taiwan’s combat power within 48 hours, and take full control of Taiwan within 72 hours.""


=== Taiwan ===

In August 2022, Hua warned that Nancy Pelosi should not visit Taiwan, threatening that, ""We closely follow Pelosi's itinerary. If the U.S. insists on going its own way, China will take firm and powerful measures to safeguard China’s sovereignty and security interests."" Later that month, after Pelosi's visit, Hua made a tweet asserting that Taiwan was a part of China because ""Baidu Maps show [sic] that there are 38 Shandong dumpling restaurants and 67 Shanxi noodle restaurants in Taipei."" The tweet was ridiculed by other Twitter users, who replied with examples of restaurant listings across the world.

He said some Japanese believe that: ""During World War II, Japan was only defeated by United States and her atom bombs. Therefore, Japan only needs to get along well with United States while ignoring other nations."" ""This is a downright incorrect viewpoint."" Cui emphasizes that, ""Japan was defeated by all the peace-loving people, including both Chinese and American people. There will be dire consequences if Japan is misled by incorrect viewpoints about past history.""On July 12, 2016, Cui spoke at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies following China's rejection of the ruling of an international tribunal arbitration case submit by the Philippines. He asserted that the attempt at arbitration was illegal as it was done without Chinese consent. Cui expressed his hope for future diplomatic resolutions to disputes in the South China Sea, and also expressed a wish for further more successful joint developments and activities with other countries.Regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, Cui states that ""the job of finding the source of the virus is one for scientists, not journalists and diplomats.""

== Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom ==
In 2010 he replaced Fu Ying as Chinese ambassador in the UK.In 2014, Liu likened Japan to Lord Voldemort, the villain in the Harry Potter series, by writing in The Telegraph: ""If militarism is like the haunting Voldemort of Japan, the Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo is a kind of horcrux, representing the darkest parts of that nation's soul."" In response, Keiichi Hayashi, the Japanese ambassador to the UK, wrote an op-ed in the same newspaper headlined: ""China risks becoming Asia's Voldemort"".In 2018, Liu published a signed article in The Guardian on the subject of the US-China trade war, noting that while China was still open to negotiation, the US is maintaining a position of unilateralism. In early May 2018, Liu noted that the North Korean government was closely watching the details surrounding the United States withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.On 24 November 2019, a BBC reporter confronted Liu over the Xinjiang internment camps at a press conference in London.

He said ""I am convinced that flourishing educational co-operation is an important source of strength for relations between China and the UK"".

The charge is groundless and highly misleading"".On 9 September 2019, Liu warned the Government of the United Kingdom of making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"". Liu said ""politicians were free to express their opinion – within limits"". On 6 February 2020, Liu claimed his embassy had received reports of anti-Chinese racism at UK universities and schools. He said ""I think there are many reasons for it. Lack of understanding of the epidemic. Of course, there is also some deep-seated racism. Not only in this country, but anywhere"". On 27 February 2020, he said China will remain an ""economic powerhouse, even after Covid-19"". On 4 April 2020, the Evening Standard published a column by Liu. He said ""As Covid-19 continues to spread around the world and the combat against the virus is at a critical stage, some politicians in the United States and here in this country, however, are spreading lies and stigmatizing China. A lie remains a lie even though it is repeated a thousand times. But we must also get the truth out."" In May 2020, Liu said anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. He also said UK MPs were in a ""cold war mindset"". On 4 July 2020, Liu told students to ""leverage their strength"" as the UK overtakes the US as the most popular destination for Chinese students for the first time. He urged students to practice patriotism and ""serve your motherland"" — activities he described as the ""foundation of all endeavor and the highest ambition in life"" and also encouraged them to contribute to ""China-UK exchanges and cooperation"" and ""bridge the cultural gap"".In December 2020, it was announced that Liu was to retire from his post as ambassador and be replaced by Zheng Zeguang.


=== Huawei ===
On 9 February 2020, Liu said Tory politicians opposed to telecoms equipment maker Huawei playing a role in the UK's 5G network are conducting ""a witch-hunt"". On 6 July 2020, Liu said the UK will ""bear the consequences"" if it treats China as a ""hostile"" country in deciding whether to allow Huawei a role in UK 5G phone networks. After the UK Government's announcement that mobile providers would be banned from buying new Huawei 5G equipment after 31 December 2020, Liu questioned whether the UK can provide a ""fair"" business environment for foreign firms. He said ""It has become questionable whether the UK can provide an open, fair and non-discriminatory business environment for companies from other countries.""


=== Hong Kong protests ===
In July 2019, Liu criticized the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, saying that it was ""totally wrong ... to talk about freedom"" after the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and that instead it was ""a matter about breaking laws in Hong Kong"". The same day, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said Hunt was ""obsessed with the bad habit of criticizing and lecturing on other countries' affairs condescendingly"". This resulted in Liu being summoned to the British Foreign Office to explain the ""unacceptable and inaccurate"" comments and Hunt warned of ""serious consequences"" if China exercised a human rights crackdown because of the protests.In November 2019, Liu said that British politicians and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee were making ""irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong"" and that Western powers were ""taking sides"" in what he said were China's internal affairs. Liu also said in a tweet that countries interfering in Hong Kong were ""only shooting [themselves] in the foot"".


=== Hong Kong national security law ===
Liu said the UK's offer of a path to citizenship for up to three million Hong Kongers amounted to ""gross interference"". He told a virtual conference ""The UK government keeps making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong affairs"". Liu further said ""We have do decide our counter-measures in accordance with the actual actions taken by the British side.""


=== Twitter incident ===
In September 2020, Liu's Twitter account was discovered to have ""liked"" a 10-second video of a woman using her feet to perform a sexual act on a man. In response, the Chinese embassy released a press statement, saying ""some anti-China elements viciously attacked Ambassador Liu Xiaoming's Twitter account and employed despicable methods to deceive the public"", and urged Twitter to investigate the matter.


== Korean Peninsula affairs representative ==
On April 13, 2021, Liu was appointed to work on matters concerning the Korean Peninsula replacing Kong Xuanyou.

== Early career ==
After his graduation from college, Qin worked as a staff member at the Beijing Service Bureau for Diplomatic Missions. In 1992, he entered China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs as attaché and Third Secretary at the Department of West European Affairs. Later, he worked at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom as Secretary and Counselor from 1995 to 2005, and worked at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Information Department as the Deputy Director-General and spokesman from 2005 to 2010.

Bush Foundation for US-China Relations, stating, ""Isn't it obvious that both China's people-center philosophy and President Lincoln's 'of the people, by the people, for the people' are for the sake of the people? [...] Shall we understand China's socialist whole-process democracy as this: from the people, to the people, with the people, for the people?""In January 2022, in an interview with NPR, Qin called the Uyghur genocide ""fabrications, lies and disinformation.""In April 2022, a special question and answer (Q&A) session between the three taikonauts of Shenzhou 13 aboard the Tiangong space station and American students was held in the Chinese Embassy in the United States, Washington, D.C.

Qin was appointed as a State Councilor during the first session of the 14th National People's Congress on the nomination of the newly appointed premier Li Qiang on 12 March 2023.


=== Removal ===
On 11 July 2023, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced that Qin would not be attending the ASEAN foreign ministers meetings held in Jakarta, Indonesia, on 13 and 14 July due to health reasons. Instead, he was represented by his predecessor Wang Yi, who is serving as the director of the Office of the CCP's Central Foreign Affairs Commission, the top diplomatic post in China at the meetings. Qin has not been seen in public since 25 June 2023 – when he held talks with counterparts from Russia, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka – and did not meet visiting dignitaries including United States Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and former United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in July. His non-availability was one of the reasons for the cancellation of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell's visit to China in July. Speculation around Qin's disappearance centered on an alleged affair with Hong Kong reporter Fu Xiaotian, who also seemed to disappear around the same time.On 25 July 2023, Qin was removed from the office as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of China by a decree signed by president Xi Jinping, after a list of appointments and removals was passed by the 14th National People's Congress Standing Committee. Qin's predecessor Wang Yi, was re-appointed to the office. China's foreign ministry and official media agencies, including Xinhua News Agency, did not explain Qin's dismissal. All mentions of Qin during his tenure as foreign minister were removed from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, though they were restored the following day.

The Journal cited two unnamed sources who stated that the relationship resulted in the birth of a child while in the United States. According to the Journal, Qin was cooperating with a CCP investigation focusing on whether the extramarital relationship or Qin's conduct had compromised Chinese national security.According to 26 September article by the Financial Times, Qin was in a relationship with Fu Xiaotian, citing unnamed sources. According to the article, Qin and Fu met in London in 2010, when both were in the UK, and they developed a closer relationship nearly a decade later in Beijing. It also mentioned that Fu had a child with the help of a surrogate mother in the US. It mentioned that Qin began to limit contact with Fu after his appointment as foreign minister, prompting Fu to drop hints about their relationship on social media.

Zhang Meifang,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Meifang,"Zhang Meifang (Chinese: 张美芳; pinyin: Zhāng Měifāng) is a Chinese diplomat who is serving as the Consul General of the People's Republic of China in Belfast, United Kingdom since 2018.


== Early life and education ==
Zhang graduated from East China Normal University and in master of philosophy from the University of Cambridge. She served as a senior visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University. She is married to politician Liu Haixing, who is currently serving as the executive deputy director of the office of the National Security Commission of the Chinese Communist Party. The couple have a daughter.


== Career ==
Zhang has previous served in a variety of roles within China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including as first secretary at the Chinese Permanent Mission to the United Nations from 1997 to 2001, first secretary at the Chinese Embassy in France from 2001 to 2004, deputy consul general at the Chinese consulates in Toronto from 2008 to 2013 and New York from 2013 to 2018.In December 2018, she was appointed as the Chinese consul general in Belfast.


=== Statements ===
According to the online statistics collected by the German Marshall Fund, Zhang had engaged in extensive forwarding of pro-Russian and anti-Western messages in Twitter since the outbreak of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. One of them being a false news, first shared by a pro-China Twitter account, that President of Ukraine Volodomyr Zelenskyy fled to Poland during the invasion.On 14 August 2022, following Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan on 2 August 2022, CGTN published an opinion piece by Zhang where she stated that ""the one-China principle was violated by a foolish action of a desperate nation, desperate to distract its own people from troubles at home"" and the ""Taiwan region is not a pawn to be played in some deviant global chess game. No nation will sit idly by in such matters.""On 23 August, Zhang shared a post on Twitter listing the wars participated by the United States as ""the history of American aggression in a snapshot!"" As the list involves wars that the United States did not start such as the American Revolutionary War, World War I, World War II and Korean War, many online users questioned how come Zhang considers World War II as an American aggression as the United States entered into the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan and then provided military aid to China during the Second Sino-Japanese War. As the post resulted in heated commentary, it was deleted without any explanation.On 4 February 2023, following the shootdown of a suspected Chinese spy balloon which flew across Canada and the United States by the United States Air Force, Zhang joked about it on Twitter stating that “perhaps China was simply giving the US a balloon, much like one would give a child to make them feel better” and if anyone else ""finds this balloon fiasco to be nothing more than a bunch of hot air?”On 13 February, in the aftermath of the devastating Turkey–Syria earthquake on 6 February, Zhang uploaded a video to Twitter that inaccurately claimed that the 1915 Çanakkale Bridge withstood the earthquake thanks to Chinese technology. Zhang wrote, ""The bridge built by China in Turkey’s withstood the earthquake #ChinaTech."" She also falsely claimed that ""a subsidiary of Shudao Group is the sole participant in the construction."" However, the bridge was built by South Korean conglomerate DL E&C along with Turkish conglomerate Limak Holding as well as South Korean company SK Group and Turkish company Yapi Merkezi while China's Sichuan Road and Bridge Group was only responsible for the installation of the bridge's steel box girders on December 2020. The bridge was also unlikely to be in any danger from the earthquake, as it is located approximately 950 kilometers (590 miles) northwest from Kahramanmaras, the city closest to the quake's epicenter. The video had been viewed more than 200,000 times before it was deleted the next day. The official Twitter account of the Chinese Embassy in France also forwarded Zhang's tweet, but deleted it after learning the relevant facts.

Hua Chunying,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hua_Chunying,"Hua Chunying (Chinese: 华春莹; born 24 April 1970) is a Chinese diplomat who has been serving as Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of China since 2021 and the fifth spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since 2012. 
After graduating from Nanjing University with a major in English language and literature in 1992, Hua joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a section member. She served as staff member, attaché, and third secretary in the Ministry's Department of Western Europe and the China Embassy in Singapore from 1992 to 2003. She served as second secretary, first secretary, and then counselor in the Mission of China to the European Union from 2003 to 2010. Hua then served as counselor at the Department of European Affairs from 2010 to 2012, deputy director of information from 2012 to 2019, and director of information from 2019 to 2021. She was appointed as the assistant minister of foreign affairs in 2021.


== Early life ==
Hua was born in Huai'an, Jiangsu. Both her parents were officials. Her father was formerly secretary of the Chinese Communist Party Huai'an County Discipline Inspection Commission, and her mother was the deputy director of a local district. She graduated from Nanjing University in 1992 with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in English language and literature.


== Career ==
After graduation, Hua joined the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China as a section member in the ministry's Department of Western Europe. Over a period of 20 years, Hua worked her way up to the position of spokeswoman. From 1995, she spent four years in Singapore as an attaché. During 2003 to 2010, she was promoted from secretary to counselor in China's mission to the European Union.
In 2012, Hua was promoted to deputy director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. She served concurrently as the spokeswoman for the ministry. In February 2018, during a prolonged absence at the Foreign Ministry, there were reports that Hua was investigated for storing large amounts of U.S. dollars in her home. On March 1, 2018, Hua returned to work as Foreign Ministry spokeswoman.On July 18, 2019, she was appointed director of the Foreign Ministry Information Department of the People's Republic of China, succeeding Lu Kang. She became the second female director-general of the Information Department after Gong Peng, the very first director-general of this department. In October 2021, she was promoted to assistant minister of foreign affairs. Hua oversees the ministry’s work related to information, protocol, and translation. Hua was a delegate to the 19th and 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.


== Commentary ==
Hua has criticized the US plea to release Pu Zhiqiang, saying, ""I think lots of people have the same feeling with me, that some people in the United States have hearts that are too big and hands that are too long. Washington should address human rights problems at home and stop trying to be the world's policeman or judge.""In 2021, she compared the January 6 United States Capitol attack with the 2019 storming of the Legislative Council Complex.


=== COVID-19 conspiracy theory ===

In January 2021, Hua renewed the conspiracy theory that the SARS-CoV-2 virus originated in the United States at the Fort Detrick Army Medical Command Installation. Her words quickly went trending on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, and Hua continued to cite evidence on Twitter, while asking the government of the United States to open up Fort Detrick for further investigation to determine if it is the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.


=== Social media ===
In February 2021, Hua said that many Western officials use Weibo and Wechat, and asked, ""Why can't Chinese people use Twitter or Facebook when foreigners can use Chinese social media platforms?"" Twitter and Facebook have been banned by the mainland Chinese government since 2009.


=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

On 24 February, at a Chinese Foreign Ministry press conference, Hua said that, ""China is still the only permanent member of the United Nations Security Council that has not yet achieved the complete reunification of the motherland."" The situation with the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine would be instructive to learn “how to fight the armed reunification”. Just as she foresaw resolution of the European conflict within 48 hours, if the “war of reunification of Taiwan” starts, the “highest goal” of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) would be to “reunify Taiwan”. The PLA would not delay and thus not give adversaries the time and opportunity to intervene militarily and politically. In Hua's vision, the PLA would also ""defeat the island’s naval and air forces in the shortest possible time, seize air and sea control, provide security for subsequent landing operations, eliminate Taiwan’s combat power within 48 hours, and take full control of Taiwan within 72 hours.""


=== Taiwan ===

In August 2022, Hua warned that Nancy Pelosi should not visit Taiwan, threatening that, ""We closely follow Pelosi's itinerary. If the U.S. insists on going its own way, China will take firm and powerful measures to safeguard China’s sovereignty and security interests."" Later that month, after Pelosi's visit, Hua made a tweet asserting that Taiwan was a part of China because ""Baidu Maps show [sic] that there are 38 Shandong dumpling restaurants and 67 Shanxi noodle restaurants in Taipei."" The tweet was ridiculed by other Twitter users, who replied with examples of restaurant listings across the world.

Wei Hongtian,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wei_Hongtian,"Wei Hongtian is a Chinese diplomat. He briefly served as the Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Somalia. In December 2014, he was appointed Ambassador of China to Somalia.


== Personal life ==
Wei Hongtian pursued his tertiary studies abroad, matriculating at the Somali National University in Mogadishu during the 1980s. He is fluent in the Somali language.


== Career ==
On 30 June 2014, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong Lei announced that China would dispatch a diplomatic team on 1 July to reopen the Chinese embassy in Mogadishu. He described the move as both recognition that the Somali authorities were making progress in their national reconstruction efforts and a symbol of the importance that the Chinese government attaches to its bilateral relations with Somalia. On 3 July 2014, Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China Wei Hongtian presented his credentials to Foreign Minister of Somalia Abdirahman Duale Beyle at an event in the Somali capital. Beyle similarly hailed the appointment as a sign of the nation's strengthening security and foreign diplomatic relations. On 12 October 2014, the new Chinese embassy officially opened in Mogadishu.On 15 December 2014, Wei Hongtian presented his credentials to President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the newly appointed Chinese Ambassador to Somalia. He is the first such envoy after the reopening of the Chinese embassy in Mogadishu. Foreign Minister of Somalia Beyle and Ambassador Wei subsequently held a joint press conference, wherein the officials pledged to further strengthen bilateral ties. As part of the local reconstruction process, Wei also indicated that the Chinese authorities were slated to implement various development projects in Somalia.In April 2015, Wei Hongtian met in Mogadishu with Foreign Affairs Minister of Somalia Abdisalam Omer to discuss ties between both nations. The meeting concluded with a signed bilateral agreement, which strengthens diplomatic relations and collaboration. As part of the treaty's stipulations, $13 million in Chinese funds will be earmarked for reconstruction and development initiatives in the economy, health, education and infrastructure sectors in Somalia. According to Ambassador Wei, the Chinese authorities are slated to continue their support for the Somali government's stabilizations efforts.

Zhao Lijian,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhao_Lijian,"Zhao Lijian (Chinese: 赵立坚; pinyin: Zhào Lìjiān; born 10 November 1972) is a Chinese civil servant who has been serving as deputy director of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China since January 2023.He joined the foreign service in 1996. Zhao became notable for his outspoken use of Twitter when he served as an envoy-level attaché at the Embassy of China in Pakistan from 2015 to 2019. From 2019 and 2023, he served as deputy director of the Information Department at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the 31st spokesperson of the Ministry. He has been described as a prominent wolf warrior diplomat during his tenure. In January 2023, Zhao was removed from the office as one of the ministry's spokespeople and was appointed as deputy director of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.


== Early life and education ==
Zhao Lijian was born in Luannan County, Tangshan, Hebei in November 1972. He studied at Luannan County No. 1 Middle School.Zhao graduated from Changsha Railway College (merged to form Central South University) with a major in foreign language studies.When he served as a first secretary at the Embassy of China in the United States, he enrolled at the Korea Development Institute from February to December 2005 and received a master's degree in public policy.


== Career ==
Zhao joined the Department of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in 1996 as a section member. He was transferred abroad and served as staff member and third secretary at the Embassy of China in Pakistan from 2003 to 2009. He served as first secretary at the Embassy of China in the United States from 2009 and 2013.Zhao returned to Beijing in 2013, and served as a first secretary and an office director at the Department of Asian Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2013 to 2015. He then served as an envoy-level attaché at the Embassy of China in Pakistan in Islamabad from 2015 to 2019.Zhao was recalled to Beijing in August 2019, and served as deputy director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from August 2019 to January 2023.Zhao was then transferred to the ministry's Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs, and has been serving as deputy director of the department since January 2023. Media reported his transfer as part of China's rethinking of wolf warrior diplomacy.


== Statements, Twitter and controversies ==
The Chinese Communist Party puts a high premium on information management, and Zhao used press conferences and Twitter to direct information and reach China's strategic goals. Although it had been banned in China in 2009, Zhao joined Twitter in 2010, becoming one of the first envoys of the Chinese government to use the social media platform. By the end of 2020, Zhao had 780,000 followers.


=== Use of Twitter ===
During his second tenure at the Embassy of China in Pakistan from 2015 to 2019, Zhao used the name ""Muhammad Lijian Zhao"" on his official Twitter account, but he dropped ""Muhammad"" in 2017 after there were reports that China banned several Islamic names in Xinjiang.Zhao became well known for his frequent use of Twitter to criticize the United States, including on topics such as race relations and the United States foreign policy in the Middle East. Paired with his press conference statements, he has established a ""long history of provocative assertions.""


=== ""Racist"" Washington exchange ===
In 2019 Zhao tweeted, ""If you're in Washington, D.C., you know the white never go to the SW area, because it's an area for the black & Latin. There's a saying 'black in & white out'"", to which Susan Rice, National Security Adviser to Barack Obama, responded: ""You are a racist disgrace. And shockingly ignorant too."" Zhao returned the insults, calling Rice ""a disgrace"" and ""shockingly ignorant"" in a tweet as well as calling her accusation of racism ""disgraceful and disgusting."" Although Zhao stood by the tweets, he deleted them. The dispute raised his profile in Beijing.


=== COVID-19 suggestions and conspiracy theories ===

On 5 March 2020, Zhao gave a press conference in Beijing and responded to an American TV host's demand that the Chinese should ""formally apologize"" for the novel coronavirus pandemic. Zhao stated that: ""The announcement is absurd and ridiculous, which fully exposes his arrogance, prejudice and ignorance of China... [t]he H1N1 flu outbreak in the United States in 2009 spread to 214 countries and regions and killed at least 18,449 people that year. Has anyone asked the United States to apologize?"" He went on to say, ""no conclusion has been reached yet on the origin of the virus, as relevant tracing work is still underway."" From here Zhao turned to Twitter.

On 9 March he condemned United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for using the term ""Wuhan virus"". Zhao retweeted Americans who were accusing Republicans of racism and xenophobia. On 12 March Zhao, without asking for permission from his superiors, appeared to promote a conspiracy theory that the United States military could have brought the novel coronavirus to China, tweeting first in English and separately in Chinese:When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!
The allegation was apparently linked to the United States' participation at the 2019 Military World Games held in Wuhan in October, two months before any reported outbreaks. Zhao accompanied his post with a video of Robert Redfield, director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, addressing a US Congressional committee on March 11. Redfield had said some Americans who had seemingly died from influenza later tested positive for the new coronavirus. Redfield did not say when those people had died or over what time period. Zhao also linked to article from the Centre for Research on Globalization which BuzzFeed News claimed was part of ""a bevy of misinformation about the coronavirus... covered by Global Times, that claimed the virus began in late November somewhere else than Wuhan."" The US State Department summoned Chinese ambassador Cui Tiankai on March 13 to protest about Zhao's comments. During an interview on Axios on HBO, Cui distanced himself from Zhao's comments and said speculating about the origin of the virus was ""harmful"". In April 2020, Zhao defended his tweets, saying his posts were ""a reaction to some U.S. politicians stigmatizing China a while ago."" In July 2021, Zhao commented that the plan on WHO's 2nd phase study was ""at odds with the position of China"" and other countries, adding, ""Why can't origins study be conducted in the U.S. just as in China?"" Reportedly, Zhao's actions and conducts created divisions within the Foreign Ministry, with many supporting it while others opposing it.On August 11, 2021, Zhao Lijian posted a tweet supporting the Chinese conspiracy theory that SARS-CoV-2 virus was developed by the United States military at Fort Detrick.


=== Treatment of Uyghur people ===

Following the leak of the China Cables via The New York Times the Chinese government has come under Western Media's and government's criticism for its treatment of Uyghurs in the Xinjiang internment camps (since 2017) as methods of confronting Islamist terrorism in Xinjiang lead by Turkistan Islamic Party. Zhao has used media statements and Twitter to defend Beijing's treatment of the minority group. Associated Press claimed that authorities in China were using forced birth control amongst Uyghur people, whilst encouraging larger families of Han Chinese. Zhao dismissed the findings of AP as ""baseless"" and showed ""ulterior motives."" He turned attention back on the media, accusing outlets of ""cooking up false information on Xinjiang-related issues"".In November 2020, Pope Francis named China's Uyghur minority among a list of the world's persecuted peoples. Zhao retorted that the Pope's words had ""no factual basis"". In January 2021, Zhao responded to questions about the Uyghur genocide during a press briefing by stating, ""China has no genocide; China has no genocide; China has no genocide, period.""


=== Five Eyes ===
On 19 November 2020, the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing group said China's imposition of new rules to disqualify elected legislators in Hong Kong appeared to be part of a campaign to silence critics and called on Beijing to reverse course.
Responding to this, Zhao said that ""No matter if they have five eyes or 10 eyes, if they dare to harm China's sovereignty, security and development interests, they should beware of their eyes being poked and blinded"".


=== Brereton Report ===
On 30 November 2020, Zhao posted on his personal Twitter account ""Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, &call [sic] for holding them accountable"", accompanied with an image of an Australian soldier who appears to hold a bloodied knife against the throat of an Afghan child. The image, originally created by the Chinese internet political cartoonist Wuheqilin (乌合麒麟), is believed to be a reference to the Brereton Report, which had been released earlier by the Australian government that month, and which details war crimes committed by the Australian Defence Force during the War in Afghanistan between 2005 and 2016, including the throat-slitting of two 14-year-old Afghan boys, and its subsequent cover-up by the Australian military. Later that day, the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison called a press conference, calling the image ""offensive"" and ""truly repugnant"", demanding a formal apology from the Chinese government and requesting Twitter to remove the tweet. China rejected the demands for an apology on the following day, while Twitter also refused Morrison's request to remove Zhao Lijian's tweet. The artist behind the illustration said it was created ""as a metaphor"". Eventually, Morrison called for stopping further amplification of the incident, and to seek conciliation. The incident had the effect of unifying Australian politicians in condemning China across party lines, while also drawing attention to the Brereton Report. It was further seen as a sign of deteriorating relations between Australia and China.The New Zealand and French governments voiced support for the Australian government and criticised Zhao's Twitter post, while the Russian government stated that ""the circumstances make us truly doubt the genuine capacity of Australian authorities to actually hold accountable all the servicemen who are guilty of such crimes"". The Chinese embassy in Paris criticized the French government's position as hypocrisy, and argued that Chinese artists have the right to caricature, referencing the French government's defense of the Charlie Hebdo caricatures. A spokesperson for the US State Department likewise accused the Chinese foreign ministry of hypocrisy for using Twitter at all when it is blocked in China. The Taiwanese government expressed concern about the Chinese foreign ministry's use of a manipulated image in an official tweet. A week after the tweet an Israeli cybersecurity firm concluded that they had found ""evidence of a largely orchestrated disinformation campaign"" aimed at spreading the tweet and China's viewpoint. The firm concluded that of the Twitter accounts which had augmented proliferation of the image, ""half were likely fake.""


=== Echoing Russian disinformation about Ukraine ===

In March 2022, amidst the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Zhao Lijian said during a press conference that ""the US' biological laboratories in Ukraine have aroused great concern"". He echoed Russian media reports saying that Russia has found out that the US was using such facilities for ""bio-military plans"". However, such claims, which circulated in Russian media since at least 2018, were previously debunked as part of Russian disinformation campaign against Ukraine. Britain's Defense Ministry said: ""These narratives are long standing but are currently likely being amplified as part of a retrospective justification for Russia's invasion of Ukraine"". Bloomberg News called it a ""conspiracy theory"". Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the U.S. Department of Defense has worked with Ukraine and other former satellites of the USSR to secure and take apart remnant weapons of mass destruction under the Nunn–Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program, which involved delivery system dismantlement and tasks pertaining to chemical and biological weapons.Zhao said that ""As the culprit and leading instigator of the Ukraine crisis, the US has led NATO to engage in five rounds of eastward expansion"" since 1999, and the near doubling of NATO membership pushed ""Russia to the wall step by step.""


=== Taiwan ===

In July 2022, Zhao warned that Nancy Pelosi should not travel to Taiwan, and threatened the Chinese government would be ""seriously prepared"" for her travel. When asked about what that meant, Zhao said that ""If the U.S. side is bent on going its own way, China will take strong measures to resolutely respond and counteract"" and that ""The United States should be held responsible for any serious consequences."" On 1 August 2022, Zhao threatened that the Chinese military would not ""sit idly by"" if Pelosi were to go to Taiwan. Zhao stated that ""We would like to tell the United States once again that China is standing by, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will never sit idly by, and China will take resolute responses and strong countermeasures to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.""


=== 2022 COVID-19 protests ===

In November 2022, after being asked about COVID-19 protests in China that were linked to the 2022 Ürümqi fire, Zhao said ""On social media, there are forces with ulterior motives that relate this fire with the local response to Covid-19.""


== Personal life ==
Zhao is married to Tang Tianru. According to reports, Tang traveled to Germany when China was under strict travel curbs, triggering an outrage on social media. In December 2022, Tang posted that Zhao was Covid-19 positive, but was unable to get medication.
